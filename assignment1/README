Part 1:

Completed Entity Relation Diagram for the following scenario:

A bank needs a new database to keep track of its branches. 

Each branch  has a branch number, street address, phone numbers (Fax and Voice), city, province, postal code and a description (like Westmount Branch).
Each branch employs at least 3 employees but normally more than 3. Employees must only work at one branch. 
Keep track of the date they start at their branch. 
Each branch is managed by an employee (the  manager) and the manager manages only one branch.
An employee has an employee number (6 digit), social security number, first name, last name,  and salary per year. 
The branch supplies 3 services. 
These services are:
Accounts (including joint accounts, 1 or 2 people). An account has a unique account number (10 digit), account type. 
The date that the account was opened by a customer should also be kept. The account must be opened by a branch and only one branch.
Every branch has at least one account.

Credit cards. A credit card has a unique credit card number (10 digit), name (Visa, Master Card, etc..). 
The date that the customers credit card expires should also be kept. The credit card must belong to a branch and only belong to one branch. 
All branches offer credit cards.

Safety Deposit Boxes: A safety deposit box has a box number. This box number is just unique to the branch, it is NOT unique to all the branches. 
Thus Branch A might have a box number 111 and Branch B might have a box number 111. A safety deposit box has a width, height and depth. 

There are customers. Each customer has a unique customer number, first name, last name, street address, city, province, postal code and phone number.
Customers can open an account and the account could be joint (2 customers share the same account but no more than 2 can share an account). 
A customer could have more than one account. Customers can get credit cards. 
They can get more than 1 credit card. A credit card can only belong to one customer. Credit cards arent created until a customer requests one. 
Customers can rent safety deposit boxes. They can rent more than one safety deposit boxes. Only one customer can rent a safety deposit box. 

All branches have customers who have accounts and customers who have credit cards but not all branches have safety deposit boxes.
Customers MUST have an account in order to be in the database but they might not have credit card or a safety deposit box. 
Credit Cards and accounts are generated as they are assigned to customers but safety deposit boxes just exist even without being rented to a customer.


Part 2:
Mapped The Entity Relation Diagram from Part 1 to a Relational Database conceptually, 
showing all tables, column heading, keys (primary and foreign, indicated if the key is primary with an underline and/or foreign with a star).
